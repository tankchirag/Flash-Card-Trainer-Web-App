#Order#
The order is to develop a learning software based on the 
ashcard principle.

The software is to be realized as a browser-based Web application and should have the following
functionalities:

 Creation and management of decks of cards.

 Creation and management of Flashcards. A Flashcard has a front side on which the
question / task is displayed, and a back side on which the answer / solution is shown.
Optionally, the card can also contain a solution hint.

 Learning mode where the cards of a deck are queried.

 Maintaining of a learning history for each card with information about when the card
was queried and whether the answer / solution was known or not.

 A learning algorithm that decides the frequency with which the cards should be presented
to the learner. (Example: If the card is answered correctly on two consecutive days, it is
presented again after 2 days.)
